A Brainfuck debugger and memory visualizer in your browser.

Many thanks to [Daniel B Cristofani](http://www.hevanet.com/cristofd/) for a
nice [intro](http://www.hevanet.com/cristofd/brainfuck/epistle.html) and
[sample programs](http://www.hevanet.com/cristofd/brainfuck/) and
[Fabian](https://copy.sh/) for the great [art](https://copy.sh/brainfuck/) that
came prior to mine.

To play around with the debugger, go to [my site](http://minond.xyz/brainfuck/)
or run locally by downloading this repo and running `make install run`.
